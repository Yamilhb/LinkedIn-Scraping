# LinkedIn Scraping

With this script we can automate LinkedIn conections with a personalized message, going through a given list of names.

Take into consideration:
* The maximun number of invitations have to be 100 per week (according to the LinkedIn politics).
* The data with the names of the people that you want to invite, must be in the *data* directory.
* The execution command is:
`python <linkedin user name> <linkedin pasword> <name of the file>`
